## 📌 Purpose

This repository exists to **document and track repeated unsolicited graphic design outreach** directed at Twitch, YouTube, Kick, and other live streamers.

Many streamers receive **constant spam messages** offering logos, overlays, panels, emotes, and branding services — often:
- Copy-pasted
- Sent repeatedly after being ignored or declined
- Sent across multiple platforms
- Sent during live streams, DMs, or business emails without consent

This project aims to provide **awareness, transparency, and documentation**, not harassment.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

- This repository is **not** intended to harass, threaten, or defame anyone.
- Entries are based on **documented behavior**, not personal attacks.
- Inclusion does **not** imply illegality — only repeated unsolicited outreach.
- All information listed should be **publicly available usernames or links**.
- No private information (emails, real names, addresses, IPs) should ever be included.

If you are listed and believe this is an error, you may request review via an issue or pull request.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Streamers are creators, not cold-lead lists.

Unsolicited design spam:
- Disrupts live content
- Overwhels smaller creators
- Creates unsafe moderation environments
- Harms legitimate designers who use ethical outreach

This repository allows streamers and moderators to:
- Recognize common spam accounts
- Identify repeat offenders across platforms
- Make informed moderation decisions
- Encourage ethical design outreach practices
