## 📌 Purpose

This repository exists to **document and track repeated unsolicited graphic design outreach** targeting Twitch, YouTube, Kick, and other live streamers.

Many streamers are constantly contacted by individuals offering graphic design services (logos, overlays, emotes, panels, branding) through:
- Live stream chat
- Direct messages
- Social media replies
- Discord DMs
- Business emails without consent

This project focuses on **awareness, transparency, and documentation**, not harassment.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

- This repository is **not intended to harass, threaten, or defame** any individual.
- Entries are based on **observable and repeated behavior**, not personal attacks.
- Inclusion does **not** imply illegality or criminal activity.
- Only **public usernames, handles, and profile links** are allowed.
- **No private or personal information** (emails, real names, addresses, IPs) may be included.

If you believe an entry is inaccurate, outdated, or resolved, you may request review via an issue or pull request.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Streamers are creators — **not cold-lead lists**.

Unsolicited graphic design spam:
- Disrupts live streams
- Overwheles small and growing creators
- Forces moderators to take unnecessary action
- Creates unsafe and unwelcoming chat environments
- Harms legitimate designers who practice ethical outreach

This repository helps streamers and moderators:
- Identify common spam accounts
- Recognize repeat offenders across platforms
- Make informed moderation decisions
- Encourage ethical marketing practices

---

## 🔍 Common Patterns Observed

Many designers documented here show **repetitive and low-effort work patterns**, including:

- Use of **free or widely available templates** downloadable from the internet
- Minimal or no customization between clients
- Portfolios where designs look **nearly identical**
- Reuse of the same layouts, fonts, effects, and styles
- Claiming “custom work” while delivering template-based graphics

Using templates is not inherently wrong — however, **mass spam outreach combined with recycled designs** raises serious concerns about quality, transparency, and professionalism.

## ⚠️ Important Note for Streamers

Streamers are strongly encouraged to **research carefully before doing business** with anyone listed here.

A common red flag:
- Designers who rely on **spamming hundreds of streamers** instead of marketing themselves professionally

Highly skilled and confident designers typically attract clients through:
- Strong portfolios
- Word of mouth
- Paid advertising
- Ethical networking
- Established marketplaces

If someone claims to be a professional designer yet:
- Spams live chats or DMs
- Sends copy-pasted messages
- Ignores “no promo” or “no DMs” rules
- Recycles free templates as “custom work”

…it may be wise to proceed with caution or avoid doing business altogether.

## 🚫 Recommendation

This repository exists for awareness.

**We recommend streamers avoid doing business with designers who:**
- Engage in repeated unsolicited outreach
- Spam live streams or private messages
- Use generic or recycled designs
- Contact creators aggressively instead of marketing ethically

If a designer is confident in their work, they should be able to:
- Build a strong portfolio
- Pay for advertising
- Market themselves professionally
- Respect boundaries and creator rules
